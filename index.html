    <h1>ADOBONG MANOK RECIPE</h1>
    <h2>FILIPINO CHICKEN IN VINEGAR SAUCE</h2>
    <h3>
      Adobong manok, often called "chicken adobo," is often considered the
      national dish of the Philippines. Although the origins of its name are are
      with the Spanish colonizers — adobo is the Spanish word for a marinade —
      Filipinos have been making tart, vinegar-based dishes since time
      immemorial.
    </h3>
    <h4>
      The vinegar marinade makes a dish that stores very well in the Filipino
      heat. Endless varieties of adobo exist and each region has its own
      specialty. Besides chicken and pork, adobo can be made with fish, squid,
      green bean and even eggplant.

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add the chicken pieces, vinegar, soy sauce, onion, garlic, bay leaf,
        peppercorns and salt to a large, non-reactive bowl and refrigerate for
        anywhere from one to four hours to marinate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the chicken and its marinade in a large pot. Add the water and
        bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer for
        30 to 45 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender. Add
        water as necessary to keep the chicken from drying out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the chicken from its sauce, reserving the sauce, and pat dry.
        Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high flame and saute the chicken
        pieces to brown them. Remove from heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the remaining sauce to a boil over medium flame and cook until
        somewhat reduced and thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss the browned chicken pieces with the reduced sauce and serve with
        rice.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>ADOBO VARIATIONS</h1>
    <o1>
      <li>
        Pork Adobo: Substitute 1 1/2 pounds of cubed pork for the chicken. The
        pork is usually browned in oil first and then simmered with the rest of
        the ingredients. Pork adobo is probably even more popular than chicken.
      </li>
      <li>Using a combination of pork and chicken is very popular.</li>
      <li>
        Sauteing the chicken or pork can be eliminated if you like, but it adds
        a lot of flavor and color
      </li>
      <li>Vary the proportions of vinegar and soy sauce to your taste</li>
      <li>
        Sugar cane vinegar is used in the Philippines, but white or cider
        vinegar can be used instead.
      </li>
      <li>Add a little sugar to round off the tartness if you like.</li>
      <li>
        Add 1 cup pineapple to the simmering sauce or use pineapple juice
        instead of the water.
      </li>
